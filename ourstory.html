                The idea of Bun Bun Bake Shop started out in Mom’s kitchen. Every Saturday morning, we were greeted by the alluring smell of her famous cinnamon buns. There’s something so warm and comforting about them that simply can’t be matched. We dreamed of sharing the magic of Mom’s cinnamon buns, and so we share Bun Bun Bake Shop with you.
